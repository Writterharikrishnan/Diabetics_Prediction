Diabetes Prediction Using Support Vector Machine
Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of a person having diabetes using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The dataset used in this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database. The model is trained to classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic based on several health-related metrics.

Dataset
The dataset is sourced from the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, which includes the following features:

Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
Age: Age (years)
Outcome: Class variable (0: non-diabetic, 1: diabetic)
